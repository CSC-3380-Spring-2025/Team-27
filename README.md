# About Our Software

This project is a psychological horror game that revolves around the player navigating a single, repeating room. The horror experience is designed to be unsettling and psychological, often subverting expectations and playing mind games. The game is inspired by Silent Hill: P.T. and Twelve Minutes, combining an eerie atmosphere with challenging puzzles and disturbing, subtle horror elements.

Key Features:

- First Person Perspective: Designed to maximize immersion, the   player experiences the game from a first-person perspective, enhancing the tension and fear.
- Single Repeating Room: The game takes place in a single, repeating room, where each progression is marked by subtle changes and psychological twists.
- Psychological Horror & Puzzles: Players must solve puzzles and uncover clues to advance through the game, each step revealing new layers to the mystery.

The project is built as a client-side desktop application using Unreal Engine 5.
